# Resume Ranker

### Problem: 
Recruiters often face hundreds of resumes per role. Manually identifying the most relevant candidates is time-consuming and error-prone, and itâ€™s easy to overlook both obvious and subtle matches!

### Solution:
This tool uses modern embedding models to represent both the job description and resumes as high-dimensional vectors. By comparing these embeddings with cosine similarity, it ranks candidates from most to least relevant, speeding up shortlisting while improving accuracy.

### Detailed Approach (backend):
Let's break the problem into simple blocks of concepts/code: 
- Accept a job description as text - perform cleaning operations if needed 
- Allow for candidate names and resumes to be uploaded (file types supported currently: .pdf, .docx and .txt)
- Load the embedding model and compute embeddings for both - job description and list of candidate resumes
- Use cosine similarity to find and rank the candidate resumes! 


### Future Direction:
The next steps look like this: 
- Add "Remove candidate" to remove specific candidates and regenerate rankings instead of re-running the entire pipeline! (done)
- Add better cleaning and preprocessing strategies for the text inputs 
- Use summarization tools to generate a summary for why the respective candidate would be perfect for the role 
- The ranking currently solely depends on the embedding model - therefore a good idea would be to experiment with different embedding models! 
- Read candidate files and names from excel file

### How to run and replicate the project in your local system? 
Step 1: Use the requirements.txt file to ensure all the necessary libraries have been downloaded. You can do this by running the following command: 

<code> pip install -r requirements.txt </code>

Step 2: Simply run the app.py file. It will prompt you to a URL link that renders a simple gradio frontend for the project! 

<code> python app.py </code>

Step 3: Add a job description in the text box. Now, add a candidate name and resume and click on 'Add Candidate' to register the details (it will show up in the table below). Repeat this process until you've added all candidates information! Click on "Get results" to view the rankings! (Please bare with the wait time - currently it takes about 4-5 minutes for a medium-to-long job description and 4 1-page resumes!). If you want to remove any candidate - simply select their name from the dropdown, remove and re-calculate the rankings!


### Feedback
Always open to suggestions! This work has been exploratory and I'd love to make it better!
